# Magist-and-Eniac-partnership-analysis

This project analyzes the Magist e-commerce dataset to evaluate its potential as a strategic partner for **Eniac**, a high-end tech retailer specializing in a premium/innovation tech products in Spain.

## Project Overview

**Business Question:**  
Is Magist a suitable partner for Eniac?
Is Magist's delivery process effecient?

**Context:**  
Eniac focuses on premium tech products. We explored Magist’s data to assess:

- Magist's tech product performance
- Customer purchasing trends
- Delivery efficiency

**Tools Used:**  
- SQL for data extraction and analysis  
- Tableau for visualization  
- PowerPoint for presenting findings

---

## Our Findings

- Only **14.6% of Magist’s revenue** and **12.5% of its sales** come from tech products.
- The vast majority of these sales were **low-cost tech items**, with very few high-end products sold.
- Magist has **6 times lesser avg sales price** than Eniac.
- Delivery data showed inconsistencies and delays, especially for tech products.

These findings suggest a **strategic misalignment** between Eniac’s premium focus and Magist’s actual product and performance metrics.
